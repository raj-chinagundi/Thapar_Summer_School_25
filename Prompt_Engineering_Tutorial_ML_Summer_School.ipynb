If you need to build on top of it to correct\\n   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at\\n   the tip of the \"master\".  This is not strictly necessary, but\\n   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.\\n\\n * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic\\n   branches, merge them into \"next\" branch.\\n\\nThe script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name\\nto be \"next\", but it is trivial to make it configurable via\\n$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.\\n\\nWith this workflow, you would want to know:\\n\\n(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to \"next\".  Young\\n    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather\\n    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been\\n    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without\\n    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would\\n    not want to rewind it.\\n\\n(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to \"master\".\\n    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not\\n    build on top of it -- other people may already want to\\n    change things related to the topic as patches against your\\n    \"master\", so if you need further changes, it is better to\\n    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the\\n    tip of \"master\".\\n\\nLet\\'s look at this example:\\n\\n\\t\\t   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"next\"\\n\\t\\t  /       /           /           /\\n\\t\\t /   a---a---b A     /           /\\n\\t\\t/   /               /           /\\n\\t       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /\\n\\t      /   /   /             \\\\         /\\n\\t     /   /   /   b---b C     \\\\       /\\n\\t    /   /   /   /             \\\\     /\\n    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"master\"\\n\\n\\nA, B and C are topic branches.\\n\\n * A has one fix since it was merged up to \"next\".\\n\\n * B has finished.

If you need to build on top of it to correct\\n   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at\\n   the tip of the \"master\".  This is not strictly necessary, but\\n   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.\\n\\n * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic\\n   branches, merge them into \"next\" branch.\\n\\nThe script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name\\nto be \"next\", but it is trivial to make it configurable via\\n$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.\\n\\nWith this workflow, you would want to know:\\n\\n(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to \"next\".  Young\\n    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather\\n    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been\\n    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without\\n    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would\\n    not want to rewind it.\\n\\n(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to \"master\".\\n    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not\\n    build on top of it -- other people may already want to\\n    change things related to the topic as patches against your\\n    \"master\", so if you need further changes, it is better to\\n    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the\\n    tip of \"master\".\\n\\nLet\\'s look at this example:\\n\\n\\t\\t   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"next\"\\n\\t\\t  /       /           /           /\\n\\t\\t /   a---a---b A     /           /\\n\\t\\t/   /               /           /\\n\\t       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /\\n\\t      /   /   /             \\\\         /\\n\\t     /   /   /   b---b C     \\\\       /\\n\\t    /   /   /   /             \\\\     /\\n    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"master\"\\n\\n\\nA, B and C are topic branches.\\n\\n * A has one fix since it was merged up to \"next\".\\n\\n * B has finished.

It provides an easy way to collect and analyze news data from CNN.\\\\n\\\\nThis documentation provides detailed information on how to install, run, and understand the project.\\\\n\\\\n## Quick Start\\\\n\\\\nTo get started quickly, follow these steps:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:\\\\n    ```bash\\\\n    pip install -r requirement.txt\\\\n    ```\\\\n2.  **Run the Scraper**:\\\\n    ```bash\\\\n    python cnnscraper.py\\\\n    ```\\\\n    The script will prompt you to select dates for news articles.\\\\n\\\\nSee the [Getting Started](getting_started/installation.md) section for more details.\",\\n    \"installation.md\": \"# Installation\\\\n\\\\nThis project requires Python 3.x.\\\\n\\\\n## Dependencies\\\\n\\\\nThe project dependencies are listed in `requirement.txt`.\\\\n\\\\nTo install them, navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\npip install -r requirement.txt\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will install:\\\\n- `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML and XML documents.\\\\n- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.\\\\n- `regex`: A regular expression module for more advanced pattern matching.\\\\n\\\\n!!! note \\\\\"Virtual Environment Recommended\\\\\"\\\\n    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.\\\\n    ```bash\\\\n    # Create a virtual environment\\\\n    python -m venv .venv\\\\n    # Activate the virtual environment\\\\n    source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\\\\\\\\Scripts\\\\\\\\activate\\\\n    # Install dependencies within the active environment\\\\n    pip install -r requirement.txt\\\\n    ```\\\\n    Remember to activate the environment each time you work on the project.\",\\n    \"usage.md\": \"# Usage\\\\n\\\\nThe `cnnscraper.py` script provides a straightforward way to collect news data from CNN.\\\\n\\\\n## Data Output\\\\n\\\\nAfter successfully running the script, two main outputs are generated in your project\\'s root directory:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **`data.csv`**: A CSV file containing the scraped news article information.\\\\n    Each row in `data.csv` includes the following columns:\\\\n    *   `news_headline`: The main headline of the news article.\\\\n    *   `news_content`: The full text content of the article\\'s paragraphs.\\\\n    *   `img_description`: The alternative text (description) of an associated image (usually the first found).\\\\n    *   `img_link`: The original URL of the associated image.\\\\n    *   `local_path`: The local path where the image is saved (e.g., `article_images/image_name.jpg`).\\\\n\\\\n    ### Dataset Example\\\\n\\\\n    A snippet of the generated `data.csv` file:\\\\n\\\\n    ![Dataset screenshot](img/datacnn.png)\\\\n\\\\n2.  **`article_images/` directory**: This folder is created to store all downloaded images associated with the scraped articles. Images are named based on their original filenames (sanitized) and saved as `.jpg`.\\\\n\\\\n## Script Interaction\\\\n\\\\nWhen you run `cnnscraper.py`, you will be prompted to interact with the script:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nAvailable Dates:\\\\n1. February 01, 2023\\\\n2. March 15, 2023\\\\n...\\\\nChoose one date at a time where you want to get news for from the available options(eg 1, 2, 3):\\\\n```\\\\nEnter the number corresponding to the date you wish to scrape. After selecting, you\\'ll be asked:\\\\n```\\\\nDo you want to select more dates? (yes/no):\\\\n```\\\\nType `yes` to select another date or `no` to proceed with scraping for the currently selected dates.\\\\n\\\\n## Error Handling\\\\n\\\\n*   If an image fails to download, an error message will be printed to the console, but the script will continue.\\\\n*   If the `data.csv` file already exists from a previous run, it will be automatically overwritten to ensure fresh data.\"\\n  },\\n  \"code_dir\": null,\\n  \"README.md\": \"# CNN News Scraper Documentation\\\\n\\\\n## Description\\\\nCNN News Scraper is a Python application that allows you to scrape news articles from CNN\\'s website.
